## NuPack for Nulogy

### Brief Description

This is part of a coding exercise for Nulogy. The goal is to create a simple library called NuPack to calculate packing costs for different packages.

### Technical Requirements

I've written this in Java 8 (and it's highly likely to be compatible with Java 7). In particular I used the Oracle JDK version 1.8.0\_45 with JRE 1.8.0\_121. I also used Eclipse Neon Java IDE with JUnit 4.12 included. 

You can get Eclipse Neon [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/marsr) if needed. 
You can get the JUnit 4 jar [here](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install) if you need it to be added to your libraries/sourcepath. 

Generally speaking I used Eclipse as both the writing environment for writing code and building the application and running tests. 

I also included an ant build file using the latest version of ant (1.10.1). You can get this version of ant from [here](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)
